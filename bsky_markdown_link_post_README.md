## How It Works

### Context Detection
The bookmarklet automatically detects if you're on a post page by analyzing the URL pattern:
- `https://bsky.app/profile/{handle}/post/{postId}` = **Post page detected**
- Any other URL = **Regular new post mode**

### User Experience

**On regular pages**: 
- Shows single "Post" button
- Creates new posts with markdown link support

**On post pages**: 
- Shows "Reply" and "Quote" buttons  
- Reply creates threaded responses
- Quote creates posts with embedded original
- No "new post" option (keeps focus on the current post)

### Reply Threading
When replying, the bookmarklet:
1. Extracts the post handle and ID from the current URL
2. Resolves the handle to a DID (decentralized identifier)
3. Fetches the original post's metadata (URI and CID)
4. Checks if the original post is part of a thread
5. Sets proper `parent` and `root` references for correct threading

### Quote Post Embedding
When quote posting, the bookmarklet:
1. Fetches the original post's metadata
2. Embeds it using Bluesky's `app.bsky.embed.record` format
3. Your text appears above the embedded original post

## Security Notes

- **App passwords are stored locally** in your browser's localStorage
- **App passwords are scoped per handle** - if you use multiple accounts, each gets its own stored password
- **App passwords can be revoked** anytime in Bluesky settings if needed
- **No data leaves your browser** except the API calls to post to Bluesky

## Technical Details

- Automatically detects your current Bluesky handle from localStorage (`bsky-handle` key)
- Converts markdown `[text](url)` syntax to Bluesky's rich text facets system
- Uses proper UTF-8 byte indexing for international character support
- Stores app passwords with format: `bsky_app_pass_{handle}`
- Creates authenticated sessions using Bluesky's official API endpoints
- Falls back gracefully if handle detection fails

### API Endpoints Used
- `com.atproto.identity.resolveHandle` - Convert handle to DID
- `com.atproto.repo.getRecord` - Fetch post metadata  
- `com.atproto.server.createSession` - Authentication
- `com.atproto.repo.createRecord` - Create posts/replies/quotes

### Thread Structure
Replies include a `reply` field with:
```json
{
  "reply": {
    "parent": { "uri": "at://...", "cid": "..." },
    "root": { "uri": "at://...", "cid": "..." }
  }
}
```

### Quote Post Structure  
Quote posts include an `embed` field with:
```json
{
  "embed": {
    "$type": "app.bsky.embed.record",
    "record": { "uri": "at://...", "cid": "..." }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

**"Unable to detect handle"**: Make sure you're logged into Bluesky and try refreshing the page

**"Authentication failed"**: Check that your app password is correct and hasn't been revoked

**"Failed to fetch post data"**: The post might be deleted, private, or the URL might be malformed

**"Post not detected"**: Make sure you're on a URL like `bsky.app/profile/handle/post/postid`

**"Links not clickable"**: Ensure you're using the correct markdown syntax: `[text](url)` with square brackets and parentheses

**Reply not threaded properly**: This can happen if the original post was deleted or if there are network issues fetching metadata

## Limitations

- **Requires JavaScript** - Won't work with JavaScript disabled
- **Bluesky domain only** - Only works on bsky.app pages  
- **Public posts only** - Cannot access private or deleted posts for replies/quotes
- **Browser storage dependent** - Clearing browser data removes stored passwords

## Purpose

This bookmarklet enhances the user experience on the BlueSky social platform by enabling the use of Markdown link syntax (`[text](url)`) for creating posts, replies, and quote posts. It intelligently adapts its functionality based on whether the user is viewing a specific post or browsing other parts of the site.
